The motivation behind this project was the need for an app that allows the user to make and save notes for what they need to do.
This project was built to give the user a platform for their to do list, one that would save the items they still need to complete and allow for deletion of items that are completed.
I learned the importance of what is in the 'href' field of the index.html. I had put in too much detail about my notes.html path and it kept causing problems for the deployment and correct usage of the application. I learned that the path for the PORT needed to be written in a specific way for the deployment in Heroku to work. 

## Installation

Open the webpage url given in the project.

## Usage

Click on the "Get started" button on the opening page. You will be taken to the note page with the previously saved notes on the left side of the screen, a form for a new note with title and text, and a + icon to make a new note. When there is a value entered into the note title and text areas of the form a save button will appear next to the +. You can click each note on the left side and it will open the note so you can view the text.
